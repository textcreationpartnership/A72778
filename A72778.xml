            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas diuers good Acts and</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances haue heeretofore bene made, aſwell by publique Proclamations, as other waies: for the reſtraining the great Abuſes daily committed and vſed in brewing and vttering of extraordinary ſtrong Ale and Beere, of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene ſhillings and ſixteene ſhillings the barrell, in ſuch vnvſuall and ſtrange manner, and by ſuch vnlawfull meaſures and prizes, as in former ages was neuer kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen and ſuffered, and growne now to ſuch a habit of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſſe and drunkenneſſe, as is fit to be reformed: Or elſe the poiſon thereof, will trench to the preiudice of the whole Kingdome, which in no wiſe is to bee ſuffered. Wherefore, the right honorable Sir <hi>Iohn Iolles,</hi> knight, Lord Maior of this honourable Citie, hauing called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, the Maiſter and Wardens of the Brewers, and Free-men of this Citty of London, and ſundry other diſcreete perſons of vnderſtanding and graue diſcretion, haue diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, the reaſons and cauſes of the great dearth of Barley and Malt at this preſent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole kingdome: finding that the prizes of Malt is one third part dearer by the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then is Rie, and beareth neere to the price of ordinary wheate: which wil make the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Earable Land of this kingdome to be ſowne with Barley. And conſequently, whereas in former times, in the knowledge of many Merchants yet liuing, That this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did yearly ſpare great quantities of wheate to be tranſported into forraign parts beyond the Seas, ſo much wheate as did returne into this kingdome in ſpecies of Golde and Siluer, yearly many thouſand poundes, which was heere Minted into the Kings Maieſties Coine: and now ſo litle wheat ſowen heere, to giue roome for Barley, that we are ſerued with wheat our ſelues, out of forraigne Countries, who draw away the Coine of this Land, both Siluer and Gold from England, for their Corne, to the like number of many thouſand pounds yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to our great preiudice: All which inconueniences, doe grow by the brewing of this heady ſtrong drink, which waſteth our Corne infinitely.</p>
            <p>And further, a new euill is crept into the City and Suburbs, amongſt the petty Victualers and Ale-houſe keepers, that become Brewers in their owne houſes of ſtrong Ale, and ſo are both Brewers and Victuallers, and retaile the ſame at two pence or three pence the quart, to the pooreſt labouring people of the City, to the miſery of their poore wiues and children, whoſe huſbands giue as much for a quart of ſtrong Ale, as would find their wiues and children both bread and drinke at home. For Reformation of the foreſaide abuſes, the Lord Maior by all the beſt meanes and power that he can vſe, intendeth foorthwith with all ſeueritie to reforme within the City of London, and Liberties thereof, to the example of the reſt of the kingdome. And therefore heereby Chargeth and Commandeth, That no Inholder, Ale-houſe keeper, Cooke, Tobacco ſeller, nor other Victualler, or keeper of Ordinaries whatſoeuer, ſhall in any wiſe, brew any drink in their houſes, neither Beere nor Ale, nor vtter, nor ſell any Ale or beere at other rates, then is by the Law appointed, (viz:) a full quart of the beſt Ale or Beere for a peny, and a full quart of the ſmaller beere for a halfe peny. And likewiſe, ſtraightly chargeth and commandeth all brewers, which are brewers by their trade either of Ale or beere, that they nor any of them, do brew any Ale or beere, at any other rates, or in any other manner then is appointed by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, nor at any other prizes, then that the Victuallers may be able to affoord the ſame at the rates aboueſaide: of a peny a quart the beſt, and a halfe peny the quart of the ſmaller. AND, that it ſhall appeare, the Contents of this Proclamation ſhall be ſtraightly looked into, his Lordſhip hath appointed in euerie Ward of London, certaine honeſt and well diſpoſed perſons, to ſearch &amp; view, throughout their Wards where any of theſe abuſes ſhall be committed, to diſcouer them to the Lord Maior, to the end, that ſeuere puniſhment may be inflicted vpon the offenders.</p>
            <p>And further, whereas of late there hath bene a verie groſſe and corrupt vſe, or rather Abuſe, ſet vp amongſt bakers of Market bread, by many Forreiners, and ſome bakers of the Citie: touching the baking of falſe ſized bread, neuer wont to bee vſed, (viz:) in baking of three-peny, fiue-peny, eight-peny, and Ten-peny Loaues of bread, to beguile the ſimple people, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren withall, in ſelling the three peny Loafe for a groat, the fiue peny for ſixe pence, the ten pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for twelue pence, which is not fit to be vſed or ſuffered. Wherefore, the Lord Maior ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chargeth and Commandeth all Bakers of bread, of what kinde or condition ſoeuer, That they, nor any of them, ſhall not in any wiſe bake, nor put to ſale, either in their ſhoppes, nor in the Markets of the Citie, any wheaten or white bread of any ſize aboue the peny loafe, &amp; two peny loafe: nor any browne or houſhold bread, aboue the peny loafe, or two peny loafe, ſixe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loafe, and twelue peny loafe, which ſhall haue the print in the top of the Loaues, (viz:) on the two peny loafe, the print of 2. on the ſixe peny loafe, the print of 6. and on the twelue penie loafe the print of 12. And if they bake or put to ſale any other bread of other ſizes and prizes, the ſame ſhall be giuen away in the Market to the poore: and the ſellers thereof committed to priſon for their wilfull offence therein committed.</p>
